# node-maintain
Maintenance program backend

This program helps keep track of the maintenance of engines, or anything that requires maintenace.

It also needs its database schema updated. I cleaned up the design to make it a bit simpler.  

want to incorporate supply chain management in next version

It also demonstrates how to set up and use:
sequelize
graphql
node
router
webpack
